        <div class="text-about">
            Yauheni had always been passionate about computers and the Internet. Hailing from a
            small rural town in country X, where he worked as a design engineer, he felt a
            persistent restlessness. Moving was his chance to escape the monotony and pursue his
            true calling: becoming a frontend developer. This was no small dream for someone whose
            life had been rooted in the simplicity of a rural existence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Determined to transform his life, Yauheni dove headfirst into the world of web
            development. He taught himself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            TypeScript, driven by a relentless thirst for knowledge. Late nights blurred into early
            mornings as he navigated through endless lines of code and debugging sessions. His
            journey was marked by moments of triumph and despair, but he never wavered.
            <br />
            <br />
            His initial foray into React was promising, but it was Angular that truly captivated
            him. The complexity and elegance of Angular resonated with his engineering mindset. With
            renewed vigor, he immersed himself in mastering the framework, his enthusiasm
            unwavering.
            <br />
            <br />
            But Yauheni's ambitions didn‚Äôt stop there. He began studying Node.js, recognizing that a
            deep understanding of backend technologies would make him a more versatile and
            formidable developer. His dedication was fueled by a singular goal: to secure an
            internship at one of the largest IT corporations in the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each day brought him closer to this dream. His journey was a testament to his unyielding
            determination and passion. Yauheni knew that the path ahead would be challenging, but he
            embraced it with a resolute heart, ready to overcome any obstacle in his quest for
            success.
